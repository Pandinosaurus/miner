\item{x}{A numeric string with north/south position}

\item{y}{A numeric string with height}

\item{z}{A numeric string with east/west position}

\item{player_id}{Integer giving the ID of a player. You can find IDs of all
current players using \code{\link[=getPlayerIds]{getPlayerIds()}}.}

\description{
Move player to position (x,y,z). The default is to move the first player who
was spawned in the Minecraft world, but other players can also be moved using 
the \code{player_id} argument. If the \code{tile} argument is set to \code{TRUE}, 
the player will be moved to the position specified by truncating the specified 
x, y, and z to integers.
